SMuFL-Browser
================

SMuFL-Browser is a web based viewer for the [Standard Music Font Layout specification](http://www.smufl.org) which facilitates searching and browsing of musical symbols. Additionally it serves as a [TEI](http://www.tei-c.org) reference for the SMuFL specification so encoders can easily add musical symbols to their texts.

Credits are due to Daniel Spreadbruy and his great work on the SMuFL specification.
